# dotfiles

A collection of configurations for my arch linux setup.

My setup: 

- Nushell (Default shell)
- Alacritty (Terminal Emulator)
- Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer)
- NeoVim (Text Editor)
- Starship (Shell Prompt)
- Bat (cat replacement)
- Rg (grep replacement)

Color Scheme:

- Solarized light
- Ayu Dark

Fonts: 

- Crimson Pro
- Noto Sans
- Inconsolata

This repository also contains my custom keyboard configuration for QMK firmware, a bunch of miscellaneous scripts, and git config.

The build script automates some of the configurations and package installations:

```bash
‚ùØ ./build
./build [(c)onsole | (f)fonts | (a)autodark | (e)verything]
```
