# dotfiles

A collection of configurations for my arch linux setup.

My setup: Alacritty(Terminal Emulator) + Tmux(Terminal Multiplexer) + NeoVim(Text Editor)
Additional: Starship(Bash Prompt) + Airline Vim + bat(cat command replacement) + rg(ripgrep, grep command replacement)

Color Scheme: Solarized (Both light and dark. Autodark submodule makes switching between these automatic and easy)

```bash
‚ùØ ./build
./build [(c)onsole | (f)fonts | (a)autodark | (e)verything | (m)ouse]
```
